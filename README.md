# hextec

A new web framework for building web applications.

## Installation

To use hextec in your Node.js project, just run

```
npm install hextec --save
```

and then you can use it.

### Building from source

Clone the repo and then run

```
npm install
```

to get all of the dependencies. The typescript sources are located in the `src` folder.

## Purpose

I was dissatisfied with Express and it's relatively bad workflow (at least for me), so I decided to write my own web framework using the HTTP module. This project however is currently in **extreme** beta, so I would not recommend using it yet.

## License

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. This means you can practically do anything with it **except** distribute closed source versions. Look in `LICENSE.md` for more details.
